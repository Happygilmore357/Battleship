BATTLESHIP - UNITY GAME IDEA

each tile has a score
-has adjacent tile with hit increases score
-all surounding tiles are untouched increases score by small amount (so as to not outweigh the above)
-surrounded by miss tiles gives perm 0 score

will target tile with highest score first

easy medium hard vary the wight given to the score increments, moving closer to randomness with each decrease in skill level

just click where you want to hit

drag drop or click drag to draw your ships

computer will place ships useing similar algorithm to targeting tiles. but reverse (favoring empty areas)

maybe use machine learning at some point to define optimal strategy by playing itself
